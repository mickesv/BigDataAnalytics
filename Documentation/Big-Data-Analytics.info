1 Document Overview
*******************

The course Applied Cloud Computing and Big Data is a 7.5 ECTS course
offered by Blekinge Institute of Technology.  The course is organised
around three themes, and all three themes must be completed to complete
the course:

   • Cloud Provisioning and Deployment
   • The Business Case for Cloud Computing
   • Big Data Analytics

   The course is divided across two source code repositories:

   • <https://github.com/mickesv/ProvisioningDeployment.git> contains
     the instructions and source code for the Cloud Provisioning and
     Deployment, and the Business Case for Cloud Computing parts of the
     course.
   • <https://github.com/mickesv/BigDataAnalytics.git> contains the
     instructions and source code for the Big Data Analytics part of the
     course.

   This document covers the third of these themes, i.e.  Big Data
Analytics.  The document is structured as a series of introductions to
different topics mixed with hands-on tasks to exercise these topics.

   The topic introductions and practical exercises are further
punctuated by quizzes that (a) serve as checkpoints of important
concepts that have been covered to that point, but also (b) introduce
further reading material to deepen your understanding of the cloud
computing business case.  *These quizzes are not marked*, but serve as a
learning aid; for you to summarise what you have learnt so far, and for
us to keep track of your progress through the material.

   The theme is examined through two assignments (See *note
assignmentCodeStream:: and *note assignmentAllAtOnce:: ), where you put
what you have learnt into practice.

   This document is available in different formats:

   • as web pages on the course platform
   • as a pdf file
   • as a TeXInfo tutorial

   The TeXInfo tutorial may require a bit more introduction.  Access
this version e.g.  through the command ‘info Big-Data-Analytics’ or in
your favourite editor though ‘C-u C-h i Big-Data-Analytics.info’ .
Basic navigation in the document is done with the following keys (try
‘info info’ for more details and further key commands):

   • <spc> (space) scroll forward
   • ’b’ Beginning of current node
   • ’e’ End of current node
   • ’n’ Next node
   • ’p’ Previous node
   • ’u’ Up (usually (but not always) to the top index page)
   • <enter> on a cross reference to open it.

2 A Note on Reading Research Articles
*************************************

This course may suggest research articles for you to read.  This may
seem a daunting task for you, but there are some general guidelines that
may help you:

   • Start by reading the abstract and the conclusions.  These will tell
     you what problem or area the article is addressing, and what the
     article contributed to solving the problem.
   • The articles in this course have – to a large extent – been chosen
     because they summarise the topics in various ways.  To find these
     summaries, look for _lists, figures, and tables_ in the article.
     Read these.  Read the text around them, or where the figures and
     tables were referenced, in order to get an explanation of how to
     interpret them.

   Generally, interpret each section of an article as follows:

   • The _introduction_ section in an article puts the problem into
     context, and might give you clues as to how other researchers have
     solved it before.  You can use this section to get a generic
     overview.
   • The _related work_ section should discuss in further detail what
     other researchers have done that is similar to, or relates to, the
     article you are reading.  This may give you an idea of how others
     have addressed the problem, and may give you pointers to other
     articles that you would wish to read.
   • The _methodology_ section explains how the study was conducted.
     Once an article is published (which they naturally are in this
     course), this is mostly interesting if you distrust some of the
     results and want to see if anything has been missed when
     constructing the study.
   • The _execution and results_ sections describe how the study was
     executed (in particular discrepancies from the planned
     methodology), and what the raw results were.  Most of the time, you
     can safely skip these sections.  Sometimes however, the _results_
     section is combined with the _analysis_ section.
   • The _analysis_ section “bakes” the results and tries to answer the
     research questions (address the identified problem).  This is
     probably the most interesting section for you to read.
   • The _discussion_ section should raise the view and try to see what
     the results actually mean in a bigger context.  What can you do
     with the results?  “So what?”.  This is a tricky section to read,
     since the authors want you to believe that their results are the
     best thing invented since hot porridge, but at the same time they
     have to identify threats to the validity of the study.  Validity
     threats are things that could have influenced the results instead
     of the sought after effect.  This may be things that happened at
     the same time, inadequacies in the researchers skills and
     abilities, or inadequacies in the research design.  Please
     remember, when (or if) reading this section, that most of the
     identified validity threats are minor obstacles (or the article
     would not have been published) that may impact the scientific view
     of the results more than the practical significance or usefulness
     of them.
   • The _references_ may give you ideas for other articles that you
     would like to read.

   The bottom line is that when being told to read a lot of research
articles, the trick is to learn how to not read them while still getting
the gist of them.  Hopefully, the “map” described above may provide some
help in identifying the parts of an article that are important for you.

3 Introduction to Big Data
**************************

*Big Data is Dead* I am seeing more and more texts that argue that _Big
Data is Dead_ (see e.g.  J.  Tigani Big Data is Dead
(https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/) (last checked
2023-03-30) ).  Their argument is essentially that while the technology
to deal with big data is sound, few users actually need it; few users
actually have enough data to be a problem for a modern computer.

   The question that remains for us to study is thus: _What killed Big
Data?_

   To be able to answer this question, we must first understand what big
data was (or is).  Chen et al.  2014 discuss the “four V’s” of Big Data.
Crude as they are, they are still a decent starting point with which to
understand what Big Data is.  The following are the claims used to
define Big Data:

Volume
     Big Data is, as the name implies, lots and lots of data.
Velocity
     Velocity refers to the rate and amount at which new data arrives
     and need to be ingested and analysed.  Essentially, if you have
     more data generators than you have capacity to receive and organise
     the data, you’re in trouble.
Variety
     Not all data arrives in the same format, which complicates your
     data reception.
Value/Density
     The signal-to-noise ratio is low in Big Data, meaning that there is
     a lot of data to process in order to pin down any meaningful
     information.  Once you do find the information, however, the claim
     is that this information is valuable enough to make it worthwhile.

   I repeat that these are the _claims_ about what constitutes big data.
It may be possible to deal with each one of these in isolation, but it
is the combination of them and the scale of them that makes Big Data a
difficult problem.  But this also means that unless either of them (at
least either of the first three) actually constitute a problem, then
there is no Big Data.  Finding the killer of Big Data is thus a matter
of finding out _who isn’t there anymore_.  So, without further ado, let
us invite the suspects into the library one by one and explore which of
them might be the killer.

3.1 Volume : The Size of Big Data
=================================

We may go about defining the size of Big Data in two ways.  One is to
look at examples of large datasets and gather anecdotal evidence about
what may be Big Data.  The other is to look at storage and processing
capacity, and establish a “lower limit” for what may be Big Data.

   First, then, some examples.  Starting with something simple, like
text, Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/) contains over 70000
e-books with expired copyrights.  Each book is usually available in a
couple of different formats, primarily including plain text, but also
html, epub, and PDF.  According to Kiwix
(https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content), it weighs in at around 75 GB.  In
comparison, the English Wikipedia appears to be around 100GB (I am too
lazy to actually download this and figure out if this is all of
Wikipedia, whether it includes images and other media, and whether the
zim file format is compressed or not).

   Source code is just another type of text, right?  Github provides a
dataset
(https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=github_repos&page=dataset&project=vagrant-test-2022&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sgithub_repos)
covering nearly 3 million public open-source licensed repositories; this
repo is around 500 GB (which consumes 2.5 TB of disk space).  As before,
I have not checked whether this number contains all versions of all
files (GitHub is, after all, a configuration management utility), and
whether binaries (such as images, generated pdf documents, etc.)  are
included in this as well.

   What about image data?  OpenStreetMap
(https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community-driven collection of map
data.  Maps for the whole planet in XML format lands in at around 125
GB.  Note that this is “just” the map data and does not include e.g.
any satellite images, so the question is whether we should call this
images or not.  A more personal example of “unstructured” images can be
found closer to home: Both my wife and myself are avid hobby
photographers with two kids.  Our personal photo database have grown to
~500 GB over the course of twenty years.

   Audio and video?  That ought to take up lots and lots of space.  For
commercial reasons, this type of data is difficult to get access to, but
we may get some ideas based on some research datasets that _are_ made
available.  For example, Spotify Research
(https://podcastsdataset.byspotify.com/) has published a dataset of 100
000 hours worth of podcasts, with a size of ~2TB (See “100,000 Podcasts:
A Spoken English Document Corpus” by Ann Clifton, Sravana Reddy, Yongze
Yu, Aasish Pappu, Rezvaneh Rezapour, Hamed Bonab, Maria Eskevich, Gareth
Jones, Jussi Karlgren, Ben Carterette, and Rosie Jones, COLING 2020
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.519/> ).  Youtube
(https://thinkcomputers.org/what-is-the-capacity-of-youtube-servers/) is
naturally coy about how much space they require, and I am not certain
they even know or care themselves how much data they have stored.  In
their case, the defining factor is probably the velocity at which data
arrives and the velocity at which data is requested, confident in that
they have done as much as they can in order to save storage space.

   With these examples it is clear that even a modern laptop has enough
storage capacity to store even a couple of these datasets.  Yes, there
are cases where this becomes difficult, and finding a scalable backup
solution for our photo collection is ever a problem, but it is still
clear that in most cases _it is not the volume itself that is the
problem, but what one desires to do with the data_.

   Essentially, one can optimise for _writing_ data, for _storing_ data,
or for _exploring_ data.

   Optimising for writing data implies that when new data arrives it
should quickly be added to whatever data is already stored.  ACID
database qualities (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are
less important than just getting the data in there and becoming
_eventually consistent_.  It is often argued that NoSQL databases have
excellent write performance simply because the usual database
consistency is not an issue here.  Whatever is received is stored as a
single document.

   In reality, this suffers from two major issues: The first is that
even if the _database_ support “free-form” data where everything is a
document and each item in the database may have their own attributes,
some form of structure is often imposed by the database access framework
(e.g.  Mongoose, which is used to access MongoDB databases from node.js
programs).  This is not such a big deal after all, since
performance-wise it only means that data items need to be well behaved
objects in your program before you push them to the database.  When
reading data, on the other hand, each data item needs to fit into the
pre-defined structure.

   The second issue is more of a problem, though.  To accept any data in
the form it comes is to abdicate from the responsibility of designing
the data.  This will (not may; it _will_) create maintainability issues
when some items are added with some attributes and other items use other
attributes.  When reading data, one must carefully check to see if all
relevant attributes are specified for each item before any processing of
the items can be done.  Your code-base gets littered with passive
aggressive data verification every place where the database is queried.
In other words; the “write anything” approach is truly only optimised
for write speed, and may come with a significant cost for storing and
exploring the data.

   When optimising for storing data the first question to ask is always:
“Do we _need_ to store this data?” Any data that is stored also need to
be maintained.  As mentioned, managing backups is a constant worry with
my personal photo collection, but this is only a small portion of what
needs to be taken care of.  Just the fact that new disk space needs to
be constantly added to keep up with the arrival of new data, and the
data need to be structured such that it can spread out across the
available disk space.  If you keep the data in a database, then the
database need to be able to grow across multiple disks or even multiple
computers.  If you keep your data in a regular filesystem, you still
need to index the data so that you can easily find the right file on the
right disk on the right computer.

   The second question is: “What is the _cost_ of keeping data?” The
information therein needs to be kept up to date and relevant, otherwise
it is a nice historical archive but probably of lesser value.  _Bit rot_
refers to a physical degradation process where bits are accidentally
flipped over time, eventually rendering data inaccessible, but _Data
Rot_ can be seen as a wider problem, where the data itself may remain
intact but the usefulness of the data degrades over time.  Today, it is
also important to keep abreast with current legal requirements such as
GDPR and whether data about citizens must be stored within their country
of origin, etc.  Even if you are fine now, there is a cost associated
with ensuring that you comply even with future changes to legal
requirements.  If, on the other hand, you have decided to not store a
particular piece of data, then you do not need to worry about whether
you are in compliance.

   The third storage decision is: “What are the most suitable formats in
which to store the data?” One good example of this is Project Gutenberg
mentioned earlier.  They may receive books in any format, and they also
serve the books in a number of different formats.  Internally, however,
they are only stored in a small set of formats.  Plaintext (ASCII)
because this format will remain readable even in the future, and HTML
because it is easy to generate other formats based on this (and because
it, too, is only a slightly more advanced version of plaintext).
Plaintext is a good alternative since it is less vulnerable to the
aforementioned bit rot, and for text storage it is also the smallest
possible format, which reduces requirements on backup and disk space.
In a pinch, it is also compressible (at the cost of becoming less future
proof), meaning that even more data can be stored before running out of
disk space.

   Exploring the data includes executing queries on the data as well as
retrieving complete data items.  If this is the most frequent activity
performed on the data, then you may need to compromise other concerns.
For example, you might add an index to quickly find answers to common
queries, but this comes at a cost of requiring more storage and that it
will take longer to insert new items.  Duplicating some data can also
help avoiding more complex data queries, but again at a storage cost.
Other “tricks” include to store and maintain searchable data in a
relational database while keeping the actual data items outside,
essentially stored as opaque blobs (binary large objects).

   There are, however, things that can be done to optimise _most_ of the
queries without adding storage overhead to all items.  For example, all
of the examples discussed earlier have “active sets” of data where some
items are requested more frequently.  I am certain they also have more
and less common search patterns for navigating the data.  Among the data
in the active set, I would also venture that only a portion of them are
actually being updated – the rest must be available but can be
statically served.

   Mind you, organising data into an active set also implies a cost.  At
regular intervals the active set must be updated to ensure that it
indeed consist of the most used data.  If, for example, the active set
consist of all entries from the last week or month, then an update needs
to run at least once per week/month.  If the active set is “last 30
days”, then you need to update it every day.  Moreover, you also need to
decide what to do with data that is no longer in the active set; how
available should it remain?  What quality requirements do you have on
e.g.  accessibility?  Security?  Recoverability?

   *Summary* In most cases, current volumes of data is manageable.  It
is not easy, and there are many design decisions to take in order to
keep the data volumes manageable, but it is doable even with old
fashioned tools such as relational databases and regular file systems.
There are costs associated with increasing sizes, but with the right
data design decisions, the technology is eminently able to keep up.

   This is strike one for big data: _Volume is no longer an issue._

3.2 Velocity : The Speed of Noise
=================================

There are two sides to velocity: keeping up with the rate with which
data arrives, and keeping up with the rate with which data is requested.
In both cases, a good starting point is to look at what classic software
architecture design suggests.  The approach by Bass et al.  ( Bass, L.,
Clements, P., & Kazman, R.  (2012).  Software architecture in practice,
third edition.  Reading MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.  )  is to make
use of _architecture tactics_, i.e.  high level architectural solutions
for how one may address different quality requirements.  Looking at the
quality attribute Performance, the tactics are split into two separate
approaches, i.e.  _control resource demand_, and _manage resources_.

   _Manage Resources_ focus on adding more computing resources to deal
with the amount of data.  In different variations, this is what one does
by scaling up and scaling out in a cloud computing solution.  Tactics
such as _introduce concurrency_, _maintain multiple copies of
computation_, and _maintain multiple copies of data_ are all approaches
to “throw more computers at the problem”.

   _Control Resource Demand_ are slightly more advanced solutions to the
problem, since they focus on making the best possible use of the
resources that are available.  _Manage sampling rate_, for example,
implies that one should not try to take on more requests than there are
resources available to process, whereas _limit event response_ is about
enqueuing requests for later processing when there is more
time/resources available.  In contrast, the tactics _reduce overhead_
and _increase resource efficiency_ suggest altering the processing
algorithm to something more efficient.

   How to manage the rate with which data arrives depends (of course) on
what needs to be done with the data, and the requirements on the data
stream itself.  If, for example, the data stream needs to be processed
so that actions can be taken immediately, there is only so much one can
do in terms of increasing resource efficiency, after which it becomes a
matter of managing resources instead.

   An example to illustrate this is billing data in telephony systems.
In the Good Old Days (TM), the billing systems would collect call data
at regular intervals from all telephone switches (manage sampling rate)
and process them so that every customer could get an invoice at the end
of the month based on how much they had called.  With the introduction
of pre-paid, this was no longer sufficient.  Instead, the moment a
customer connected, data about this must be sent _post haste_ through
the billing system to figure out the price of the current call and the
amount left to call for by this customer, etc., and ultimately terminate
the call when the customer did not have any more pre-paid money to call
for.  Once the processing algorithms are optimised and overhead reduced,
the only thing remaining is to add more computing resources.

   That’s not entirely true, though.  Some more things can be done: work
with the data generators (in this case the telephone switches) so that
the data is more pre-processed even before it enters the billing system,
and simplify the required processing e.g.  by a flatter structure of
what it should cost to call different types of numbers, regions, or
countries.

   Working with the data generators can often be fruitful, especially if
the data is generated in client software under your own control.  The
data which are processed fastest by the server is the data not sent at
all.  This connects to the _value_ aspect of Big Data; rather than
collecting all the data and hope to at a later stage figure out which
information is valuable, some up-front design to cull the initial data
can often work miracles on the required resources.

   I named this section “the speed of noise”.  If most of the data that
arrive is without value, then it really does not matter whether
algorithms and platforms can be improved sufficiently to take care of
it: it is still junk.

   Strike two for big data: _Lack of up-front planning doth not Big Data
make._

   But what if the data _aren’t_ junk?  The billing data above clearly
has value and need to be processed.  Yes, but does it need to be stored?
Does all of it need to be stored?  Does all of it need to be stored for
all eternity?  Does it need to be processed down to its final form
within hard relative requirements?  We still have the option to _limit
event response_ and _prioritise events_ to ensure that we do the needful
right now and the rest eventually.

   Analogous to the discussion above about optimising for collecting the
_right_ data to facilitate processing of new data, the next step is to
optimise the storage of the data in order to facilitate querying of the
data.  We have grown comfortable with the idea that storage is cheap,
and because we _can_ generate new reports out of old data someone
_might_, and thus we’d better hold on to all data for all eternity.

   Fortunately (for big data), generating reports is only one small part
of what one may do with data.  Different types of data analysis that can
be done include:

   _Linear Data Analysis_, where each datum is studied once and perhaps
transformed into some new state.  In the end, an analysis across all
data is produced.  Examples of such queries may count how often a
certain phenomenon occurs, or the correlation between different
attributes of each datum.  Even more concretely, one might wish to
transform the data about each phone call to add the cost of it, or count
of how often a particular number is called, or collecting information
about the duration of all phone calls in order to create a new tariff.

   _Combinatory Data Analysis_ is similar, but include joining several
datum into a single entity in order to conduct the analysis.  If you
remember your database theory, this is the realm of inner, left, right,
and outer joins.  With a bit of luck (and a certain amount of foresight
in your database design), you may even be able to use database queries
to perform much of this type of data analysis.  In fact, this is really
not that different from the linear data analysis except that it may take
a bit longer to set up and structure the data for this type of queries.
The join essentially creates a new data set, and if similar queries are
going to be run frequently it may be worthwhile to store this new data
set in some way or at least instruct the database to index the data so
that similar queries can be run faster.

   Some types of data analysis can be parallelised, and especially
linear or combinatory data analysis lends itself well to splitting up
the work in smaller parallelisable computations, followed by one or a
series of merge steps to calculate a final result.

                map                 reduce
     (a b c)  -------> (a' b' c') ----------> X

   However, not all algorithms lend themselves to this type of
independent ‘map’ step.  Optimisation problems in particular may require
frequent synchronisation between the otherwise independent workers.
Consider the following algorithm (This is a very crude reinterpretation
of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) Algorithm):

     Step 1: Distribute workers randomly across the entire search realm.

     Step 2: For each worker, look around where they are and identify the nearest “best fit”.

     Step 3: Let all workers vote on who has the best “best fit”.

     Step 4: Move all workers closer to the best best fit.

     Step 5: Unless all workers are in the same place, goto Step 2.

   Step 3 is important in this algorithm since otherwise most workers
will fall down in a local optimum and never go looking for anything
better.  By synchronising across all workers, this is – somewhat –
avoided.  But the key point here is that this synchronisation step is a
common feature of many optimisation algorithms for that particular
reason (to avoid local optima), and it presents an obstacle to large
scale parallelisation of the algorithm.  A few factors play a role here:

   • How often the workers need to synchronise (synchronisation is often
     done as a part of every iteration in the original algorithms).
   • How time-consuming the calculations are for each iteration and
     worker.
   • How much memory each worker requires per iteration.
   • How many workers there are.

   The algorithms themselves usually include additional parameters such
as how much to move each worker in each iteration, and how many
iterations that are allowed (or whatever other end-criteria is used),
but these affect the execution time in general but not the scalability
of the algorithm.  The scalability trade-off is whether the computations
are so time consuming that it is worth the overhead effort of scaling
out, synchronise the executables for the workers over the network,
allocating memory to run each worker, etc., and then also synchronise
all workers between each iteration.  On the other hand, running things
locally might be an option if the number of workers (and their
collective execution time per iteration) is small enough to not warrant
such overhead costs.

   I will refer to these types of analyses as _Synchronisation-Intense
Data Analysis_, and the issue with them is that while it may be possible
to parallelise such algorithms they do not necessarily scale linearly.

   The last type of analysis that I would like to name is _NP-Complete
Data Analysis_.  Note that whereas in computer science NP-Complete is a
very specific and narrow class of problems with a mathematical
definition of what makes them NP-complete, I am perhaps not adhering
strictly to such formal definitions in my naming.  What I mean is that
in some analysis problems every new datum needs to be collated against
all existing data, leading to an exponential increase of execution time
rather than a polynomial increase as the dataset grows.  For a one-off
analysis this does not matter much if it takes a day instead of an hour
to perform an analysis.  However, for a continuous stream of data, it
becomes difficult to both analyse the data in the stream and add it to
the existing dataset.  In these instances, it quickly becomes important
to _redefine the problem_ to avoid such pitfalls.  Exactly how to
redefine the problem depends on the problem itself and the analysis one
wishes to perform on a given dataset.

   *Summary* The velocity with which new data arrives is not necessarily
a problem with modern hardware, but there are still some considerations.
Firstly, one may wish to perform some early filtering of noise and
valuable data, e.g.  to keep the storage volumes down.  Secondly, there
is a difference between arrival velocity and request velocity, and the
toolbox for addressing them differs significantly.  Thirdly, if new data
needs to be analysed at the same pace as it arrives there are several
analysis types and some are absolutely not suitable for real-time
analysis.  The best option then is to redefine the problem so that it
can be solved with more mundane analysis tools.

   All in all, these considerations add up so that in the end even
_small data can cause big challenges_.  Thus, velocity remains in the
room and cannot be accused of having killed Big Data.

3.3 Variety : Different Origins or Different Formats
====================================================

The reason to include _variety_ as one of the Big Data challenges is not
necessarily because data from the same source may arrive in different
formats.  Of course this also happens, for example when data arrives in
the form of a text document.  Advocates for NoSQL databases would like
you to believe that this type of variety is one of the biggest
challenges, and that is why you should want a _document store_ rather
than _column-based data_ as you would have e.g.  in a relational SQL
database.  In contrast, I would argue that this type of variety is quite
trivial to deal with by a bit of up-front design to understand what the
problem is, which data has a bearing on the problem, and how to analyse
it.

   Rather, the challenge with respect to data variety stems from the
fact that the data analysis may require input from many different
sources, and it may not be possible to know up-front which data entries
from each source that will be necessary for the analysis.  This means
that it may not be possible to filter the data streams beforehand.  Data
acquisition thus has to resort to collecting and storing all the data
from the sources.  A certain amount of cleaning can be done on the data
from each source (e.g.  remove duplicate entries and entries that are
obviously out of scope, and convert the data to an item in the
database), but it is often not possible to perform any more advanced
filtering.  _This_ is the real challenge with respect to data variety:
it is impossible to know up front which data has value and which should
be discarded, and this complicates many of the solutions previously
discussed for dealing with volume and velocity (or makes them impossible
to use).

   Storage volume may no longer be an issue for Big Data, but we did
argue that velocity may be a challenge depending on the type of analysis
that needs to be done.  The challenge with variety thus means that the
dataset may grow faster than it would otherwise have to do, which may
impact the analysis velocity.

   The toolbox is the same as before, i.e.  to try to filter as much as
possible as early as possible, but with an added emphasis on regular
culling of the already collected data.  As before, the challenges with
Big Data is not about finding a computer which is fast enough, but
rather to intelligently analyse the data needs and devise strategies for
dealing with this.

   In fact, let’s look a little closer at the cost of intelligent
analysis.  A simplified formula for calculating the power consumption of
a cloud computer (based on “How can I Calculate CO_2-eq emissions for my
Azure VM?  (last checked 2023-04-11) ) is: ‘E[Wh] = (n_cpu * P_cpu[W] *
time[h])’ where ‘n_cpu’ is the number of CPUs and ‘P_cpu’ is the power
consumption per CPU.  The formula suggested by S.  Bergman also includes
other factors such as memory power consumption and the power consumption
of any GPUs, but for simplicity’s sake these can be ignored for now.
What remains now is to estimate the power consumption per CPU and how
much of that CPU which is being used by us (as opposed to any other
tenant on the same cloud server).

   Thermal Design Power (TDP) is a measure listed by hardware
manufacturers, so with a bit of matching between what type of computer
and CPU is offered by the cloud provider and what the manufacturer of
that specific CPU lists for their TDP, one may find out the energy
consumption of one CPU running at full speed: ‘TDP_cpu[W]’ .  Multiply
this with our load ‘l[percent]’ and the time ‘t[h]’, and we may arrive
at an estimated energy consumption for our application: ‘E[Wh]= (n_cpu *
TDP_cpu * l * t)’.

   Assume we want to reduce the load with for example 10% over a 24h
period on a bog-standard dual CPU cloud machine, we may insert the
following numbers: ‘E = (2*165*0.10*24) = 792 Wh ≈ 0.8 kWh’.  Being in
south Sweden and thus tightly connected to the European power market
(which, it should be noted, is likely _not_ where the cloud provider is
located), this would mean saving 100g of CO_2 equivalents per day.  Run
the server for a year to save 36kg of CO_2 equivalents.

   Humans are part of a natural cycle where we only eat “fresh” organic
material (unless you have a penchant for eating crude oil), and thus we
are only re-releasing the CO_2 from this organic material back into the
natural cycle that will feed the next crop.  However, for the sake of
this calculation, we _do_ exhale roughly 1kg of CO_2 equivalents per
day.  Working 8h/day for 20 days/month a single developer can thus spend
almost half a year thinking about how to reduce the load by 10% for the
same amount of CO_2 equivalents.

   Yes, this is extremely simplified.  Yes, CO_2 equivalents does not
necessarily mean that all equivalents are equal.  Yes, humans are part
of the natural cycle so their breath is not a net increase of CO_2 into
the atmosphere.  Yes, we should probably look closer at how they get to
work (do they walk or ride a bike, or do they drive a Chelsea tractor)
instead.  No, they are not allowed to use a computer or anything else
consuming energy while thinking.  No, not even coffee.  But you get the
idea: There is a lot to be saved by analysing the problem before
throwing more resources at it.

   *Defensive Programming* Cycling back to the _variety_ aspect of big
data that we started this section with, the lure of not being forced to
structure one’s data is that one adopts a more _lassiez-faire_ approach
to processing data upon arrival.  Over time, this leads to an extremely
defensive programming style for data retrieval, a not at all extreme
example of which is presented below:

     return DocumentStore.find(query)
         .sort({time:1})
         .catch( err => {
             debug('Error while fetching data. \nQuery: %s \n Error: %s', query, err);
         })
         .then( result => {
           if (result) {
               if (result.field) {
                   if (!isNaN(parseFloat(result.field))) {
                       if (0 >= parseFloat(result.field)) {
                           // Finally, here is some code
                           // that actually does something useful
                       } else {
                           throw 'result.field is negative';
                       }
                   } else {
                       throw 'result.field is not a float';
                   }
               } else {
                   throw 'result.field does not exist';
               }
           } else {
               throw 'did not receive any result from query';
           }
         })
         .catch( err => {
             debug('Error while parsing data. \nQuery: %s \nError: %s', query, err);
         });

   This not efficient programming, it is is a passively aggressive word
salad!  The question that someone forgot to ask in this project was
whether data is written more frequently than it is read.  Remember also
that frequency in this case means both number of times per time unit as
well as number of places in the code-base.  If the latter is more than
“one and only one place”, this relaxed attitude to up-front planning of
data formats have created a maintainability bomb just waiting to
explode.

   But I digress.

   The point is that _this_ type of variety (i.e.  that the same data
source produce data entries of varying quality) can be handled at
different times; at arrival time, at storage time, by some background
process, at retrieval time, or not at all.  Each of these times have
different costs in terms of efficiency, reliability, and
maintainability, and an application designer need to balance these
against each other.  If arrival velocity is the most important
requirement and the data cannot be cleaned e.g.  on the client-side,
then maintainability nightmares such as above are perhaps the only
possible solution.  However, I suspect that modern computers can do a
lot more cleaning up on arrival time than one may think, and so I’d
rather ensure that once the data hits the database it is well formed and
all fields are used as they should.  Part of my suspicion is that the
cost of maintaining a system (probably across several decades) will in
most cases outweigh any performance benefits.

   *Summary* Variety as such is likely not a problem anymore: modern
computers are able to process and store data at a scale that covers most
“big data” use cases.  The complication with variety stems from when
data from many sources need to be collated in order to determine _what_
to store in the first place.  The challenge then becomes how and when to
perform data maintenance in order to clean up and cull the existing data
to keep the volume down and streamline future data management and
maintenance.

   We could summarise this to: _Data Variety is mostly a design and
management problem, not a computing power problem_.

3.4 Value : The Cost of Noise
=============================

It is easy to confuse value with cost, and they are often seen as two
sides of the same coin.  So the first thing to realise is that value has
_nothing_ to do with the cost.  What’s more is that value is subjective.
_Das Ding für Mich_ is not the same as _das Ding für Euch_ (as Immanuel
Kant would have said if someone had given him the chance).

   The claim, and the whole reason for the hype around Big Data, is that
within these massive streams of data there are veins of gold just
waiting to be mined by a resourceful company.  So let’s collect all the
things and later on blame the developers for not finding the gold that
you just know _must_ be there.  Why else would everyone be talking about
Big Data?  Eventually, and as with all buzzwords, simply stating that
“_we work with big data!_” implies that _your_ company are sitting on
this vein of gold, and know how to tap into it, and often this is enough
to increase the value of your company.  Even if we, in the end, conclude
that Big Data is indeed dead, there will still be pressure to claim that
your company is working with Big Data.

   But I digress.  Again.

   The real reason why value is included as one of the four ’V’s of Big
Data is because whatever value the data may have ought to outweigh all
the costs related to Big Data analytics and Big Data Management.

                      ----------
                   ----------------

   Some would argue that just _having_ data represent an untapped
potential, especially if it is data about customers (or potential
customers).  Perhaps easier to understand is that the value of the data
lies in what it _enables_.  For example, collecting data about the
health of a fleet of engines enable more apt maintenance, data may
enable process improvements, sensor data may enable active interventions
to save resources (e.g.  cover up crops in anticipation of hail storms),
or data about previous purchasing patterns may enable deeper market
insights.

   On the _cost_ side, aside from the technical costs of collecting,
storing, and analysing the data, there are also costs incurred to
_curate_ the data.  Keeping the data updated with current events, fixing
previous mistakes in the data, culling data that no longer have any
value, adhering to legal requirements such as GDPR, maintaining data
consistency, and keeping “proof of origin” of the data are all examples
of activities that a data curator may work on.

   *Summary* The question must always be whether the value outweighs the
costs.  To treat data as Big Data just to satisfy a marketing whim is
one sure way to allow the costs to skyrocket.  So be sure that you
actually _have_ to “go Big Data” before you do.

   This is strike three for Big Data: _Data is not inherently valuable
just because it is Big!_  More analysis is needed to decide whether
_you_ are sitting on a potential goldmine or not.

3.5 Summary: From Big Data to Big Data Analytics
================================================

We’ve got three strikes against Big Data:

  1. Volume is no longer an issue.
  2. Lack of up-front planning doth not Big Data make.
  3. Data is not inherently valuable just because it is Big!

   Left in the room is _velocity_, which we declared as innocent to
killing Big Data.  Upon closer inspection, however, I would argue that
the reason why velocity remains is not necessarily Big Data.  It is, in
fact, _Big Data Analytics_.

   Whatever value one hopes to get out of the data is enabled through
some sort of analysis, and this analysis may be more or less complicated
to perform.  Likewise, the speed and frequency at which the analysis
needs to be made differs significantly from problem to problem – ranging
from real time analysis to once-every-blue-moon analysis, and spanning
everything from a simple query to a NP-complete regurgitation of the
entire database.

   Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is all the rage these
days, and we all know that they require enormous training sets to become
really good.  Aren’t they examples of Big Data?  Well, they _can_ be,
even if there are plenty of smaller examples where you can download the
entire dataset to your own laptop.  Bear in mind also that _training_ an
artificial intelligence and _using_ it are two separate activities.  You
may have all the time and resources in the world to train your AI, but
will probably only need a fraction of the original dataset available for
using the AI.

   _“Beautiful Evidence”_ by Edward Tufte is an interesting book about
how to present data in graphics as well as in text, and how to do this
while remaining true to actually available evidence (there is an entire
chapter arguing about the dangers of PowerPoint).  The following quote
is apt with respect to machine learning:

     What the passive voice is for verbal reasoning, certain statistical
     methods are for data reasoning: anti-causal, a jumble of effects
     without causes.  In particular, the techniques of data mining,
     factor analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling crunch and grind
     vast matrices down into small lumps but don’t test causal models.
     These techniques are perhaps useful for those who have lots of data
     but no ideas.  To be relevant for decisions and actions, whatever
     emerges from data crunching must somehow turn into evidence about
     causal processes.

   “... Lots of data but no ideas.” This pretty much sums it up, don’t
you think?

   Later, Tufte reasons about the old adage “Correlation is not
Causation”, and concludes that the shortest accurate statement one can
make about correlation and causation is that: _Empirically observed
covariation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality._
When it comes to Big Data and much of the recent hype around machine
learning, this is often forgotten.  The fact that you have a lot of data
does not mean that you are able to unveil any particular cause.  You are
certainly not going to do it just by using a machine learning algorithm;
you need to construct an explanation model as well.

   Given the way we often work with machine learning algorithms where we
use one part of the data (after some magic hand-waving to fill in blank
spots or deal with outliers) in order to train our algorithms in order
to predict the remaining parts of the data, there may be thousands or
millions of ways to fit a model, and the only measure we are certain of
is that the model fits the rest of our data set.  Once we unleash this
model onto other data sets, we will likely find out that we have
over-fitted the model to our one original data set.

   And then what do we do?

5 Big Data Analytics in Practice: Problem Overview
**************************************************

The Qualitas Corpus (See <http://qualitascorpus.com/>) is a collection
of software systems and their source code, created and maintained by
Ewan Tempero, University of Auckland.  It was originally created in
order to have a curated collection of software systems to perform
research studies on, but it is large enough to be useful for this course
as well.  As discussed in the introduction (See *note introduction::),
it is perhaps not big enough to be called Big Data today, but it is
still large enough to cause a bit of problems when trying to perform any
form of analysis on it – as we shall see.  For that reason, it does not
matter that the most recent version of the corpus is getting a bit long
in the tooth (the most recent version is from 2013): we can still use it
for our analyses.

   Using this dataset, we are going to go hunting for _Code Clones_.  A
code clone is a piece of code that is duplicated in one or more places
within a set of source code files.  Typically, code clones are created
by copying pieces of code with little or no modifications in order to
replicate some functionality.  In general, there are four types of code
clones that can be identified:

   • Type-1: Identical code fragments except for variations in
     whitespace, layout, and comments.
   • Type-2: Syntactically identical fragments except for variations in
     identifiers, literals, types, whitespace, layout, and comments.
   • Type-3: Copied fragments with further modifications such as
     changed, added or removed statements, in addition to variations in
     identifiers, literals, types, whitespace, layout, and comments.
   • Type-4: Two or more code fragments that perform the same
     computation but are implemented by different syntactic variants.

   Obviously, the effort required to identify and match clones increases
with the type, where type 1 clones can be detected using relatively
simple string matching, whereas already type 2 clones require some
knowledge about the compiled program’s abstract syntax tree.  Type 3 and
type 4 clones require additional semantic understanding of what a code
fragment performs.

   Code clones, beside being examples of a bigger class of problems, are
usually a code smell.  In the simplest case they imply that if the code
needs to be extended or bugs fixed, the developers need to find all
places in the code where the change needs to be made.  Such processes
are usually error prone and mistakes are likely.  Taking a step back,
code clones imply that development resources are not spent as
efficiently as possible, since obviously different developers (or the
same developer) are working with the same task.  Even further steps
back, code clones can be used as a red flag that indicate that code has
been copied from other places, e.g.  StackOverflow, or code that may be
covered under different licensing terms.

   Keeping track of code clones is thus desirable.  Once clones are
identified, there are two main strategies on how to handle the problem:

   • refactor the code such that the functionality is not duplicated
   • maintain a registry of code clones that can be used to lookup
     clones when changes to the code are made

   Please note that code clones are not _per se_ a design flaw to avoid
at all costs.  As often in engineering, the decision on how to handle a
problem depends on the particular situation.  You might find the work by
Kapser and Godfrey useful ( Kapser, Cory J., and Michael W.  Godfrey.
“‘Cloning considered harmful’ considered harmful: patterns of cloning in
software.  Download Cloning considered harmful’ considered harmful:
patterns of cloning in software.” Empirical Software Engineering 13.6
(2008): 645.  )  as they identify code clone patterns, describe their
advantages/disadvantages, long term issues and provide advice on how to
manage them.

   Most Clone Detectors work according to the same algorithm, as
outlined below:

  1. Pre-processing: Remove uninteresting code, determine source and
     comparison units/granularities
  2. Transformation: One or more extraction and/or transformation
     techniques are applied to the pre-processed code to obtain an
     intermediate representation of the code.
  3. Match Detection: Transformed units (and/or metrics for those units)
     are compared to find similar source units.
  4. Formatting: Locations of identified clones in the transformed units
     are mapped to the original code base by file location and line
     number.
  5. Post-Processing and Filtering: Visualisation of clones and manual
     analysis to filter out false positives
  6. Aggregation: Clone pairs are aggregated to form clone classes or
     families, in order to reduce the amount of data and facilitate
     analysis.

   This process is the same for all types of clones, but the
transformation and match detection can be made arbitrarily complex.

6 Task: Downloading and Describing the Qualitas Corpus
******************************************************

The first step is to ensure access to the Qualitas Corpus.  For
convenience, the corpus is available from an FTP server at BTH, but
given the size we would rather not have you download it more often than
you need to.  Once you have downloaded it once, we am sure you will
agree with us.  Thus, we provide you with the basics to create a docker
image with the sole purpose of downloading the Qualitas Corpus for you.
Since the corpus should survive restarts of the docker container, we
will be unpacking it in a separate docker volume, which we will keep and
mount from different containers.

   *Tasks*
  1. Download the BigDataAnalytics repository:

     ‘git clone https://github.com/mickesv/BigDataAnalytics.git’

  2. Build the ‘CorpusGetter’ image (found in ‘Containers/CorpusGetter’
     ) and tag it as ‘corpusgetter’

  3. Create a volume for the Qualitas Corpus: ‘docker volume create
     qc-volume’

  4. Run the ‘corpusgetter’ image with the ‘qc-volume’ mounted and
     instruct it to fetch the corpus: ‘docker run -it -v
     qc-volume:/QualitasCorpus --name qc-getter corpusgetter FETCH’

  5. If all goes well, this should end by printing some statistics about
     the fetched corpus and then pause.  If not, you can re-run the
     ‘corpusgetter’ image without any commands, which will only print
     these statistics and then pause: ‘docker run -it -v
     qc-volume:/QualitasCorpus --name qc-getter corpusgetter’ .  Note
     that pressing any key will terminate the script and end the
     container, please do not do this yet.

  6. In a separate terminal, enter the running container with ‘docker
     exec -it qc-getter bash’ and browse around.  Do spend some time to
     acquaint yourself with how the QualitasCorpus is structured, where
     to find the actual source code for the systems in it, and what else
     you can find for each system.

8 Assignment Task: Working with a Stream of Data
************************************************

The Code Stream Clone Detector consists of two parts, a
_CodeStreamGenerator_ and a _CodeStreamConsumer_.  Below, a brief
overview of each is provided.

   *CodeStreamGenerator* The generator is just a placeholder for
whencesoever new files may be submitted to the clone detector for
inspection.  This may, for example, be through a website where users
submit suspicious code, or via a hook in the configuration management
system that automatically send all commits for clone detection.  The
CodeStreamGenerator expects the previously generated ‘qc-volume’ to be
mounted under ‘/QualitasCorpus’ so that it has some code to “generate”.
You could, of course, mount any code repository in this place, and
CodeStreamGenerator would be none the wiser.

   The source code for the CodeStreamGenerator is found under
‘Containers/CodeStreamGenerator/’.  It consists of a Dockerfile, a bash
script, and two test files that will be sent first if you give the
‘TEST’ flag to the container.  Please take a moment to study the
Dockerfile and the bash script so you understand what they do.

   *CodeStreamConsumer* The consumer is a ‘node.js / express.js’ app,
the source code of which is found under ‘Containers/CodeStreamConsumer/’
, that waits for a HTTP ‘POST’ request with a file in it.  Each file is
processed in turn using the ‘processFile()’ function, clones are
detected, and statistics are collected.  Opening a web browser to
‘http://localhost:8080’ (Assuming you’ve instructed docker to forward
port 8080 on the host to port 3000 in the CodeStreamConsumer container)
displays the time it took to process the last file, the code clones
found so far, and the names of the thus far processed files.

   In the ‘src’ directory, you will find a small set of files:

     $ tree
     .
     ├── CloneDetector.js # This is the actual Clone Detector, discussed further below
     ├── Clone.js         # The Clone class represents one identified Clone
     ├── CloneStorage.js  # A Singleton Class to keep track of already identified Clones
     ├── FileStorage.js   # A Singleton Class to keep track of already processed files
     ├── index.js         # Start file for the system.
                          # Sets up the express app and contains
                          # the ~processFile()~ function.
     ├── SourceLine.js    # The SourceLine class represent a single line
                          # (including its original line number) in a file.
     └── Timer.js         # This class is used to start and stop timers as needed.


   The ‘processFiles()’ function follows the previously outlined overall
process for code detection, with pre-processing, transformation, match
detection, post-processing, and storage.  Primarily, it is the
‘CloneDetector’ class that implements these steps.

   In the CodeStreamConsumer a ‘file’ is the central concept through all
of these steps.  Each processing step may add new fields to the ‘file’
object.  Just before storage, it will contain the following fields:

     file.name       // Full path and name of the original file.
     file.contents   // Original contents as a single string.
     file.lines      // An array of SourceLines.
                     // These are generated by CloneDetector::#filterLines(),
                     // which replaces empty lines and comment lines with ''
                     // so they can be easily cleared later.
     file.chunks     // An array of Chunks, which are just arrays of
                     // SourceLines, each having the length CHUNKSIZE.
     file.instances  // An array of Clones. The processing steps will
                     // refine this list so that only true and
                     // as-long-as-possible Clones remain.

   *Tasks* With these introductions out of the way, it is time to
actually fix and run the application.

  0. Generate images for the generator and the consumer, tag them
     ‘csgenerator’ and ‘csconsumer’, respectively.

  1. Start the application using ‘docker compose’ with the given
     ‘stream-of-code.yaml’ .  You may wish to modify the ‘DELAY’ to
     something bigger during your first tests so you can see what is
     going on.  You will also notice that the ‘cs-consumer’ container
     introduces a bind-mount to the source code of the app so that you
     can edit the code locally and it will restart automatically.

  2. Study the source code of the CodeStreamConsumer so that you
     understand it.  You will notice that there are two implementation
     tasks, identified by ‘TODO’ statements in the code.

  3. The first task is to complete the implementation of the
     ‘CloneDetector’.  The smallest possible edit for you is to
     implement the three methods as suggested, but feel free to be more
     creative here.

  4. The second task is to add a new landing page in ‘index.js’ for more
     detailed timing statistics (not just data on the last processed
     file).  Your own creativity sets the boundaries here, but it is
     useful to be able to see trends over time for how long it takes to
     process each new file.  You may also wish to normalise the
     processing time for each file with the number of lines it contains.
     Make use of the test files ‘A.java’ and ‘B.java’ to see if you are
     able to correctly identify clones (feel free to write a new
     CodeStreamGenerator that just send these two files on repeat).

  5. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, run the app for a
     longer period of time so you can get some proper statistics out of
     it.  Make note of what happens, when it happens, and try to reason
     about causes and remedies.

   *Summary* We have now:
  1. Created and used a docker image/container to fetch a
     very-nearly-Big-Data repository of source codes, i.e.  the Qualitas
     Corpus.
  2. Stored the QualitasCorpus in a docker volume, ‘qc-volume’, for use
     in subsequent steps
  3. Created a docker image to simulate source code being generated in a
     continuous stream.
  4. Created a node.js app to consume this stream and look for code
     clones in any of the previously submitted files.

10 Improving the Clone Detecting Algorithm
******************************************

The CodeStreamConsumer suffers from a few issues that makes it less
suitable for Big Data.  The most obvious issue is of course that it
hangs (at least for me) before it finishes processing all the files even
in the relatively small Qualitas Corpus.  This really isn’t very
surprising, considering that the ‘FileStorage’ class keeps all the
processed files in memory.  Not only that, to speed up processing it
keeps a chunkified version of the file _also_ in memory, essentially
doubling the memory footprint of every file.

   In fact, most of the time the original file is not needed once the
initial processing is done, so we can and should offload all of that
into a database.  Studying the ‘FileStorage’ class, it can easily be
seen how this might be done.

   I leave it as an exercise to the avid student to implement and
measure what retrieving every file from the database each time a new
file arrives for processing will do for the processing times.  A middle
ground would be to store the original file but keep the chunks in
memory.  This would at least reduce the memory footprint down to just
one instance of each file.  This is an improvement, but still not very
Big Data of us.  We can do better.

File: Big-Data-Analytics.info,  Node: Hashing,  Next: O(n^2),  Up: Improving the Clone Detecting Algorithm

10.1 Hashing
============

A seemingly unrelated issue is that every chunk comparison requires
‘CHUNKSIZE’ comparisons of SourceLines.  As it turns out, the next
improvement solves both of these problems, i.e.  fewer comparisons and
smaller memory footprint.  One approach to reduce complex data to a
small fixed-size comparable unit is through _hashing_.  For example the
music identification service Shahzam <https://www.shazam.com/> uses
hashing to store and match music (Nicely explained in a Youtube video
_How Shahzam Works_: <https://youtu.be/kMNSAhsyiDg> ).

   The trick with hashing (which, by the way, the ‘String.hashCode()’
method in Java fails at) is that for every unique input the hash
function produces a single unique fingerprint.  Thus, the same input
always produce the same output, and no two inputs (which are different)
produce the same output.  So rather than having to compare data of some
arbitrary size (‘CHUNKSIZE’ of source code, ‘x’ seconds of noise, or the
DNA of an extinct reptile), it is enough to compare the generated hash
code to determine if the original data is the same.

10.2 O(n^2)
===========

In the current implementation, every file, indeed _every chunk_, is
compared to every other file and chunk.  This is the equivalent of using
bubble sort, which is never a good idea and absolutely positively
definitely never ever _ever_ a good idea if you are planning to process
Big Data.  With hash functions we have introduced the idea of a
“fingerprint”, and the logical next step is to keep a list of all
fingerprints _and where they came from_.  If the same fingerprint have
two (or more) origins, it is a clone, which is what was to be shown.
The data structure, for you algorithms and data structure nerds out
there, is a _Dictionary_, where the key is the hash value of the chunk
of code and the values are the locations where this key can be found.

         Key        - Values
     |
     +-- AEF623...  - File GH/line 4-8
     |
     +-- 1ED322...  - File AK/line 25-29, File AK/line 48-52
     |
     +-- GJHT55...  - File OB/line 12-16
     |
     +-- MH6555...  - File NJ/line 56-60
     |
     +-- 7878GF...  - File KI/line 4-9, File KI/line 88-92, File OO/line 4-9
     |
     +-- 0D21HG...  - File MK/line 89-93
     |

   The overall process for each file now becomes:

  1. Generate chunks and transform each chunk into a hash value.
  2. Add the tuple ‘<hash value, file location>’ to the Dictionary Of
     All Chunks
  3. Filter the Dictionary Of All Chunks so that only entries with more
     than one value remains.  These are candidate Clones.
  4. For each remaining ‘file location’, find all adjacent file
     locations and expand the candidate Clones accordingly.
  5. Repeat until no more adjacent file locations.  What remains are
     unique and expanded Clones.
  6. For each Clone, use the ‘file location’ to extract the original
     source code for the clone; add this to the Clone.
  7. Add to list of identified Clones.
  8. Repeat.

   There is an opportunity to optimise in steps 2 and 3 so that we keep
track of only the currently processed file.  Otherwise, the expand
function in step 4 will take much longer.

   The implementation of hash tables such as this are usually quite
optimised for finding elements (or where to write a new element),
bringing these operations down to a best case Big-O complexity of ‘O(log
n)’ (which assumes that all your trees are balanced and the wind is
blowing in the right direction.  The bottom line is that we can’t really
improve the _writing_ any further).


File: Big-Data-Analytics.info,  Node: From File-by-File to All-at-Once Analysis,  Next: Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast,  Prev: O(n^2),  Up: Improving the Clone Detecting Algorithm

10.3 From File-by-File to All-at-Once Analysis
==============================================

The elephant in the room remains.  We are still processing one file at
the time, so the overall complexity is still stuck to the bubble-sort
‘O(n^2)’ quagmire.  This is kind of the whole point with this exercise:
In order to get any further, we need to re-think the problem.  The
_file_ is no longer the most appropriate data “atom”, even if we still
have to start (and end) there.  The algorithm we are looking for now
would be to:

  1. For All Files At Once, generate chunks and transform each chunk
     into a hash value.
  2. For All Chunks (now only a hash value and a location), Add the
     tuple ‘<hash value, file location>’ to the Dictionary Of All
     Chunks.
  3. Filter the Dictionary Of All Chunks so that only entries with more
     than one value remains.  These are candidate Clones.
  4. For each remaining ‘file location’, find all adjacent file
     locations and expand the candidate Clones accordingly.
  5. Repeat until no more adjacent file locations.  What remains are
     unique and expanded Clones.
  6. For each Clone, use the ‘file location’ to extract the original
     source code for the clone; add this to the Clone.
  7. Add to list of identified Clones.

   It turns out we were almost there!  Steps 1 and 2 are modified to
work on all files at once, and the expand in step 4 remains a challenge.

   *Map and Reduce* Before continuing, we need to introduce the
functional programming concept of MapReduce (Also mentioned as a Cloud
Architecture Pattern in the Cloud Provisioning and Orchestration part of
the course).  The basic trick is to stop thinking about iterations and
procedures where you _first_ do something and _then_ do something else.
Instead, with functional programming you spend more time describing what
the input data looks like, and how you want the output data to look
like.  Once you know this, you write a function to get from the input
data to the output data and _map_ it onto your entire collection.

   • ‘map()’ applies a given function element by element to a collection
     of elements and returns a collection of new (or modified) elements.
   • ‘reduce()’ aggregates the list of results from ‘map()’ into a
     single result.

   These two simple principles (coupled with a bit of ‘filter()’,
‘find()’ , ‘exists()’ , etc.)  are surprisingly versatile for data
analysis problems.  Sometimes (as with the clone detection algorithm
discussed so far), the problem or the required input and output data
formats need to be rephrased a bit, but once you do the world’s your
oyster.  Even better, ‘map()’ can easily be parallelised since each
element should be transformable by itself.  The ‘reduce()’ can also be
parallelised, but this requires a bit more work.  Being so very
versatile, it is no surprise that you will find implementations of
MapReduce in places such as databases and in many programming languages
(such as lisp, of course, but also Java 8’s Streams API
<http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/07/31/java8-stream-tutorial-examples/>,
and in JavaScript
<https://www.sitepoint.com/map-reduce-functional-javascript/> ).

   Let’s try to turn the previous algorithm into something
MapReduceable.  While we are at it, we also need to acknowledge that not
all things should be solved by _our_ programming.  Some tasks are better
left to a database.

Map
     Transform
     Input
          Array of files
     Output
          Array of Chunks containing ‘{filename, startLine, endLine,
          contentHash}’
     Comment
          Technically, the output is an Array of Arrays of Chunks, but
          this is quickly flattened into an Array of Chunks.
     Side Effect
          Files is stored somewhere accessible (e.g.  a database)

Reduce
     Merge output from Transform map
     Input
          Array(s) of Chunks
     Output
          Dictionary of ‘<contentHash , Array of Chunks>’
     Comment
          Just storing the chunks to a database will take care of this
          step for us.

Filter
     Match Detection
     Input
          Dictionary of ‘<contentHash, Array of Chunks>’
     Output
          Dictionary of ‘<contentHash, Array of Chunks>’ where Array of
          Chunks has length > 1.
     Comment
          This is a simple database search.

Reduce
     Expand
     Input
          Dictionary of ‘<contentHash, Array of Chunks>’ where Array of
          Chunks has length > 1.
     Output
          Array of Clones containing ‘Array of cloneInstances {filename,
          startLine, endLine}’
     Comment
          As we will see, this is the real killer.  We will study two
          ways of addressing this step.

Map
     Format
     Input
          Array of Clones AND Access to files
     Output
          Array of Clones containing ‘{ Array of cloneInstances,
          sourceCode }’
     Comment
          This is strictly not needed; the clones are already identified
          by the previous reduce, but can be solved with a database
          join.

Reduce
     Merge output from Format map
     Input
          Array(s) of Clones
     Output
          Array of Clones
     Comment
          Only needed if the previous map is done in parallel.

   A comment on the ‘Filter’ Step: If we do decide to implement this
ourselves instead of relying on a database, this can be done as a Map
(returning null if ‘Array.length == 1’) or (better but less
parallelisable) as a Reduce.

   When parallelising a ‘map()’ operation, the input is typically split
into several parts, each of which is executed by a separate computing
unit.  In the extreme case there is one computing unit per entry in the
input (e.g.  when using Azure Functions or Amazon Lambdas).  However, to
minimise overhead costs of distributing data, running a function, and
collecting the results, it may be desirable to instead distribute a
block of data to each computing unit.  With many frameworks, optimising
the ‘split size’ is an important step of fine-tuning the performance of
a big data analysis.

   With several computing units, each executing their own ‘map()’ on a
section of the data, it becomes evident that the outputs from each
computing unit need to be merged.  Not all MapReduce frameworks leave
the data in a nice state; expect to see a series of Arrays simply
concatenated together even if the next step requires the input data to
be at least sorted.

10.4 Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
==================================================

Shakespeare be damned, we _do_ want this to run fast.  And in parallel.
And be distributable.  So which programming language should we choose
for this?

   Until now, JavaScript have served us well.  Map and Reduce are part
of the standard feature set for JavaScript, and with Promises it is also
possible to run the ‘map()’ in parallel, but not distributed (granted,
there are some open source packages for distributed MapReduce, but most
of the ones I could find were last modified around 2018).  Moreover, the
general consensus of The Internet is that one does not reach for
JavaScript when building a high performance computing solution.  So
let’s explore the options.

   We _could_ go down the rabbit hole and implement everything in C or
C++ (‘std::transform’ and ‘std::reduce’ were added in C++17), but I am
not in the mood to go hunting for memory leaks, and distribution remains
an issue.

   Java?  With Java 8 and the Streams API, there is a native
implementation of MapReduce, as well as support for working with
infinite data streams.  Writing in Java would also have the benefit of
opening up to many of the Apache Software Foundation’s data processing
tools such as Hadoop <https://hadoop.apache.org/>, Spark
<https://spark.apache.org/>, or Storm
<https://storm.apache.org/index.html>.

   The downside with all three of these, in my humble opinion, is that
none of them are ready to be released outside of a university lab.
Setting them up and actually getting the master node and worker nodes to
communicate is _painful_.  There is no reliable list of which network
ports that need to be open on each type of node in the network, the used
network ports change between versions (even minor versions), and by
default you need to essentially keep all ports above 10000 open (and
hope that this is sufficient; the port to use for a particular job is
assigned at random and sometimes you get a port number lower than
10000).  Older versions communicated via unencrypted http requests
without any authentication.  And even when you do have everything up and
running, Hadoop MapReduce will fail three times out of ten (I know: I
have tested).

   However.

   The only other reasonable distributed computing alternative I have
found is Disco <http://discoproject.org/>.  And then you have Python on
your hands.

   So Java it is.  Or Clojure, since I feel adventurous.  The benefit of
using Clojure for this is that infinite data streams are inherent to the
programming language instead of added as an afterthought, so the program
code can focus on the problem at hand rather than juggling data to fit
the right Java Enterprise Object model.  And before you start
complaining about your lack of experience in Clojure, consider the
following “Master Foo and the Recruiter” Koan (more Unix Koans (some of
which are hilariously outdated) can be found at:
<http://catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/>):

     A technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of Unix
     hackers were strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo to
     learn more about the Way. Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR
     offices of a large firm.

     The recruiter said, “I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or become
     annoyed when I ask them how many years of experience they have in a
     new programming language. Why is this so?”

     Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor. The
     recruiter was puzzled, and asked “What are you doing?”

     “I am learning to walk,” replied Master Foo.

     “I saw you walk through that door” the recruiter exclaimed, “and you
     are not stumbling over your own feet. Obviously you already know how
     to walk.”

     “Yes, but this floor is new to me.” replied Master Foo.

     Upon hearing this, the recruiter was enlightened.

11 cljDetector: All-at-Once Clone Detection
*******************************************

In this section we go through the implementation for our All-at-once
Clone Detector.  Please do spend some time to read this section and the
included discussion of various design decisions.  More importantly, do
spend some time with the source code to acquaint yourself with it.
Understanding this implementation helps you understand a key component
of Big Data Processing: how to work with seemingly infinite data
streams.  While the overall clone detection algorithm has been described
earlier, the same map/reduce concepts are applied at every step along
the way to filter and transform data streams by treating each individual
item in isolation (as much as possible; there are occasions where some
form of state need to be kept, and the implementation introduces a few
different solutions for these occasions).

   In ‘Containers/cljDetector’ you will find the All-at-once clone
detector.  To start this on the full QualitasCorpus, you may use the
‘all-at-once.yaml’ file in the root directory as well.  The source code
for the program is found in ‘Containers/cljDetector/src/cljdetector’:

     $ tree
     .
     ├── core.clj
     ├── process
     │   ├── expander.clj
     │   └── source_processor.clj
     └── storage
         └── storage.clj

   where ‘core.clj’ is the starting point (containing the ‘-main’
function), and the other three files are packages dealing with (as their
names imply) storage, processing of source files, and clone expansion.
The ‘-main’ function reads as follows:

     (defn -main
       "Starting Point for All-At-Once Clone Detection
       Arguments:
        - Clear clears the database
        - NoRead do not read the files again
        - NoCloneID do not detect clones
        - List print a list of all clones"
       [& args]

       (maybe-clear-db args)
       (maybe-read-files args)
       (maybe-detect-clones args)
       (maybe-list-clones args)
       (ts-println "Summary")
       (storage/print-statistics))

   which corresponds to the previously discussed MapReduce chain as
follows:

   • ‘(maybe-clear-db args)’ No correspondence, this is just there to
     optionally clear the database from previous attempts.
   • ‘(maybe-read-files args)’ This is the first map “Transform” and the
     first reduce “Merge output from Transform map”.
   • ‘(maybe-detect-clones args)’ The Filter “Match Detection” and the
     “Expand” reduce.
   • ‘(maybe-list-clones args)’ The final “Format” map to join clones
     with their original files.

   So far, so good.  Let’s look at the ‘maybe-read-files’ function next
(since the others are shaped in more or less the same way this is as
good an example as any):

     (defn maybe-read-files [args]
       (when-not (some #{"NOREAD"} (map string/upper-case args))
         (ts-println "Reading and Processing files...")
         (let [chunk-param (System/getenv "CHUNKSIZE")
               chunk-size (if chunk-param (Integer/parseInt chunk-param) DEFAULT-CHUNKSIZE)
               file-handles (source-processor/traverse-directory source-dir source-type)
               chunks (source-processor/chunkify chunk-size file-handles)]
           (ts-println "Storing files...")
           (storage/store-files! file-handles)
           (ts-println "Storing chunks of size" chunk-size "...")
           (storage/store-chunks! chunks))))

   If the list of command line arguments ‘args’ , when transformed into
upper-case, does _not_ contain the word “NOREAD”, define some local
variables (which will only be available inside the ‘let’ statement):

   • ‘chunk-param’ is just a step along the way to get a usable
     ‘chunk-size’
   • ‘file-handles’ is a set of all files, i.e.  the result of calling
     ‘source-processor/traverse-directory’ .  This is a lazy sequence,
     so no handles are actually created until needed (which will be in
     the call to ‘source-processor/chunkify’ or maybe even in the
     ‘storage/store-files!’ call).
   • ‘chunks’ is a set of all chunks for all files.  This is also a lazy
     sequence, so it will not be evaluated until it needs to be (in the
     call to ‘storage/store-chunks!’ ).  By convention, function names
     ending in an exclamation mark have side effects, in the case of
     ‘storage/store-chunks!’ this side-effect is the storing of the
     results to the database.

   Once the variables are defined, most of the processing have (at least
nominally) been done and what remains is to store the results to the
database.  I say “nominally” because in fact none of the actual
processing has happened yet; because of lazy sequences, the processing
only happens in these last two calls to ‘storage/store-files!’ and
‘storage/store-chunks!’.

   The final piece of this function are the interspersed calls to our
‘ts-println’ function to print timestamped status messages, and a whole
lot of closing parentheses to back out of the ‘let’, the ‘when-not’, and
the ‘defn’ expressions.

11.1 First Run on full Qualitas Corpus
======================================

The results of running the first version of this program on the full
Qualitas Corpus yields the following data on my laptop:

Processing Step                Database Collection   #Items      Processing Time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reading and Processing Files                                     0 min
- Storing Files                files                 132000      1 min
- Storing Chunks               chunks (size 20)      18 * 10^6   50 min
Identifying Clone Candidates   candidates            586000      15 min
Expanding Candidates                                             fails after +2h
- Storing Clones               clones

   Yes, I ran this on my not at all very super impressive laptop that
was still able to manage without any permanent damage other than to the
CPU fan.  I mention this just to forestall any arguments that your
computer is too tiny to cope with big data.

   An observation when correlating this data with the processes running
on the computer during each step is that the database is using all
available CPUs whereas Clojure (and its execution as a java virtual
machine) is limited to two main processes.  One of which I strongly
suspect is the garbage collector.  For cloud deployment, this implies
that the database node will benefit from having multiple CPUs whereas
the cljDetector can cope with a much smaller node.  It also means that
the database is most likely able to cope with the increased load that
any parallelisation of the cljDetector can incur, and that it is worth
studying ways of parallelising at least the ‘map’ steps in the
cljDetector.

   Storing the files is quick, I suspect that Clojure can do a lot to
help out with simple data transfers behind the scenes.  Storing chunks
is much slower, and I willingly grant that the
‘source-processor/chunkify-file’ function can probably be much improved.
The real improvement would however be to reduce the number of chunks per
file, and one might be led to believe that the ‘CHUNKSIZE’ parameter may
help with this.  However, since there is essentially one chunk created
for each line in each file, the only difference is at the end of the
file where you may create ‘CHUNKSIZE’ fewer chunks per file.

Chunk 1: File lines 1 -- 1 + CHUNKSIZE
Chunk 2: File lines 2 -- 2 + CHUNKSIZE
@dots{}
Chunk n: File lines n -- n + CHUNKSIZE
Chunk n+1 : File lines n+1 -- n+1 + CHUNKSIZE

   Thus, ‘CHUNKSIZE’ only determines the size of the smallest possible
clone.  What _may_ be impacted by the ‘CHUNKSIZE’ is the hash encoding.
I leave it as an exercise to the reader to investigate the effect of
MD5-encoding chunks of different sizes.

   However, the real killer is the “Expanding Candidates” step – not
only because it fails to complete, but because it takes a long time to
get to the point where it fails.  This is discussed further below (see
*note elegant-expansion:: and *note beer-expansion:: ).

11.2 Expanding Elegantly but Inefficiently
==========================================

The _elegant_ way to expand clones is by using a ‘reduce’ operation like
so:

     (defn expand-clones-elegantly [candidates]
       (reduce (fn [clones candidate]
                 (let [{overlapping true remaining false} (group-by
                                                           #(overlaps? candidate %)
                                                           clones)]
                   (if (empty? overlapping)
                       (conj clones candidate)
                       (conj remaining (reduce merge-clones candidate overlapping)))
                 )) [] candidates))

   In plaintext: with every candidate, split the already found clones
into two piles (This is what the ‘group-by’ does; One that overlaps the
new candidate (all elements where ‘overlaps?’ evaluates to ‘true’) and
one with all the remaining clones (where ‘overlaps?’ evaluates to
‘false’ ).  If there are no overlapping clones, this is a new clone and
is conjoined to the existing list of clones.  Otherwise, we want to
remove the overlapping clones (conveniently already done with the
‘remaining’ list) and just store a new clone that merges all of the
overlapping clones into one.  Beautiful, isn’t it?  This is the version
that fails above.

   As it turns out, this introduces a performance antipattern called
“The Ramp”.  Every new candidate that does not overlap any existing
clones will add one more item to the list of clones.  Sometimes a few
items are removed, but most of the time the list of clones just grow.
The time it takes to ‘group-by’ thus gets longer and longer all the time
like a ramp: it starts out small but grows continually.  Eventually
something has to break:

     Execution error (MongoCursorNotFoundException) at
     com.mongodb.operation.QueryHelper/translateCommandException
     (QueryHelper.java:27).  bigdataanalytics-clone-detector-1 | Query
     failed with error code -5 and error message ’Cursor
     7063045859606288607 not found on server dbstorage:27017’ on server
     dbstorage:27017

   Why does the _database_ throw an error in the ‘expand-clones’ method?
There are no database calls there.  Hint: whenever possible Clojure
tries to use _lazy collections_, meaning they are not generated straight
off but only on an as-requested basis.  This is part of why and how it
is possible to work with infinite data series.  The other clue is that
the database connection defaults to recycling open cursors after 10
minutes, if a new candidate is not requested in more than 10 minutes the
database is going to kill the connection.  We could force Clojure’s hand
and wrap the call to ‘storage/identify-candidates!’ in a ‘doall’ block,
making sure that all candidates are in memory before we start the
‘expand’.  However, we would still have the ramp antipattern in there,
so the time per candidate is still going to grow and ultimately
something else is going to break for us if we _do_ try to throw Real Big
Data (TM) onto this algorithm.  Most likely our sanity will be the first
to go.

   Just to prove that there is nothing technically _wrong_ with this
algorithm, here is the execution data for only a part of the
QualitasCorpus, i.e.  only the Eclipse SDK:

Processing Step                Database Collection   #Items       Processing Time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reading and Processing Files                                      0 min
- Storing Files                files                 22634        < 1 min
- Storing Chunks               chunks (size 20)      3.3 * 10^6   10 min
Identifying Clone Candidates   candidates            39689        1 min
Expanding Candidates                                              5 min
- Storing Clones               clones                2515         < 1 min

   So there.  :-P

11.3 Expand with “Aleph-null Bottles of Beer”
=============================================

The alternative to being elegant is inspired by an ancient song (who
knew that _this_ was Billy Bones’ true treasure!):

     Lots and lots of candidates on the wall!
     Take one down,
     stretch it abound,
     store it as a clone,
     and remove what we found.

   Translate this to Clojure, and we get the following:

     (defn maybe-expand [dbconnection candidate]
       (loop [overlapping (storage/get-overlapping-candidates dbconnection candidate)
              clone candidate]
         (if (empty? overlapping)
           (do
             (storage/remove-overlapping-candidates! dbconnection (list candidate))
             clone)
           (let [merged-clone (reduce merge-clones clone overlapping)]
             (storage/remove-overlapping-candidates! dbconnection overlapping)
             (recur (storage/get-overlapping-candidates dbconnection merged-clone)
                    merged-clone)))))

     (defn expand-clones []
       (let [dbconnection (storage/get-dbconnection)]
         (loop [candidate (storage/get-one-candidate dbconnection)]
           (when candidate
             (storage/store-clone! dbconnection (maybe-expand dbconnection candidate))
             (recur (storage/get-one-candidate dbconnection))))))

   Where:
   • In ‘expand-clones’ we “take one down” as long as we can find one.
     ‘maybe-expand’ “stretches it abound” and then we store it as a
     clone.
   • In ‘maybe-expand’ we find any candidates that overlap and stretch
     our clone to encompass these too (in ‘merged-clone’).  Removing all
     the “used” candidates from the database as we go, we then loop back
     to see if the newly stretched clone happen to overlap with any new
     candidates.
   • The two clojure commands ‘loop’ and ‘recur’ go hand in hand to
     overcome the principle of immutable data by replacing iterations
     with recursion.

   The Execution time for the ‘Expanding Candidates’ step with Eclipse
SDK is now down to slightly over two minutes.  _me adjusts his tie and
brushes off an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve._

      ///   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

            | get-overlapping-candidates ) and the clones are stored in the database |
            | instead of in memory. But is that the actual core of the solution, or  |

       v    | only one candidate (and possible expansions) is kept in memory. Second |
            | is that we shift processing from clojure to the database, so the       |
            | database connection does not time out as easily.                       |
            |                                                                        |
            | But the biggest factor is, I think, that the bundle of joy             |
            | get-overlapping-candidates is essentially a series of filters (which   |
            | databases are really good at) where already the first $match quickly   |

            | Also, for every successfully expanded clone the set of candidates      |
            | shrinks, whereas in the "elegant" solution we just get more and more   |
            | clones to match every new candidate with. If the database can execute  |
            | the query for the first clone candidate (and why shouldn't it, it is   |
            | after all just a set of filters), life is only going to get easier for |
            | every subsequent clone candidate.                                      |

11.4 Expand with Aggregation Pipeline
=====================================

A third option, which we will not explore further, is to use an
_aggregation pipeline_ in MongoDB to do the expansion.  We are already
using an aggregation pipeline for parts of the expansion, but not for
all of it:

     (defn get-overlapping-candidates [conn candidate]
       (let [db (mg/get-db conn dbname)
             collname "candidates"
             clj-cand (from-db-object candidate true)]

                        {$addFields {:candidate candidate}}

                            :cond

                              {$or
                               [{$and

                                  {$lte ["$$this.startLine" "$instances.endLine"]}]}

                                  ]}]}]}}}
                          :instances 1
                          :numberOfInstances 1
                          :candidate 1
                          }}
                        {$match {$expr {$gt [{$size "$matches"} 0]}}}
                        {$group {:_id "$_id"
                                 :candidate {$first "$candidate"}
                                 :numberOfInstances {$max "$numberOfInstances"}
                                 :instances {$push "$instances"}}}
                        {$match {$expr
                                 {$eq
                                  [{$size "$candidate.instances"} "$numberOfInstances"]}}}
                        {$project {:_id 1 :numberOfInstances 1 :instances 1}}])))

   An aggregation pipeline is (these days) MongoDB’s preferred way of
doing map/reduce-like processing.  How to read this is as a series of
processing steps, e.g ‘{$match}’ , ‘{$addFields}’, ‘{$unwind}’,
‘{$project}’, and ‘{$group}’ where each step filters or transforms the
data stream in some way.  There is much to say about what can and can’t
be done with an aggregation pipeline, a good starting point is the
official documentation:
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/>.  Eventually it boils
down to _as long as the problem is defined in the right way, the data
processing step becomes “easy”_.

   This option will not be explored further in this course, but it does
deserve mentioning.  Any data processing we can offload to the database
is one thing less for our application to worry about, the database is
excellent at juggling data streams, and has built-in support for
parallelism (and even horizontal scaling).

   If someone more well versed in the ins and outs of database wrangling
than yours truly is willing to attempt this path, I shall be more than
happy to update this document with how you did it.

11.5 Second Run on full Qualitas Corpus
=======================================

Using the “Beer Expansion Algorithm” on the full Qualitas Corpus yields
the following numbers:

Processing Step                Database Collection   #Items        Processing Time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reading and Processing Files                                       0 min
- Storing Files                files                 ≃ 132000      1 min
- Storing Chunks               chunks (size 20)      ≃ 18 * 10^6   ~1h
Identifying Clone Candidates   candidates            ≃ 586100      20 min
Expanding Candidates
- Storing Clones               clones                ≃ 25000       6h 20 min

   Notice 1: I don’t _think_ it matters much since I had CPUs to spare
but I had to participate in a Zoom call during the candidate expansion
step, which may have slowed things down for me.  To remember when it is
time for you to run this exercise is to plan it so that you do not have
to use the computer yourself at the same time.

   Notice 2: During the expand-step it is now MongoDB processes that are
consuming most CPU resources, but only on two CPUs.  The Beer Expansion
Algorithm has thus managed to push the workload to the database, but is
still limited by how many and how quickly requests can be dispatched
from the Clojure/Java processes.  The need to parallelise the expansion
algorithm thus remains.  In fact, the expansion algorithm is already
parallelisable by adding a second ‘reduce’ step that consolidates any
overlapping clones into one, much in the same way it is done for
candidates today.

12 Assignment Task: Implementing Monitoring
*******************************************

It is time for you to contribute to this project.  As it stands, the
cljDetector prints status updates together with timestamps to the
terminal (ignore, if you please, that the timestamps are usually off by
some hours; you can fix this with the Dockerfile but it is not
necessary).

   However, it does not provide any way to monitor the progress within
each processing step, which processes that are currently consuming most
CPU, or any fine-grained statistics such as the time to create a chunk
or the time to expand each clone.  Moreover, if cljDetector were to run
at a cloud provider somewhere, it may not be possible to monitor
terminal output either.

   This is where you come in.  Since we _have_ the database, and since
each processing step incrementally add data to this database, we can use
this to monitor progress from a separate process.  In fact, you can do
this already now in a separate terminal by running ‘mongosh’ on the
database node and query the database directly.  With a small
modification, the status updates (which all use the
‘cljDetector.core/ts-println’ method) can also be written to a
collection in the database so that we have access to them too.

   *Tasks*
  1. Modify ‘cljDetector.core/ts-println’ to also add the timestamp and
     message to the database with a call to a new method
     ‘storage/addUpdate!’ .  Implement the ‘addUpdate!’ method in
     ‘storage.clj’ so that messages are stored in the new collection
     ‘statusUpdates’.

  2. Implement a separate Docker Container – in your own choice of
     programming language – that monitors the database and regularly
     updates with the current count of ‘[files chunks candidates
     clones]’ , as well as any new ‘statusUpdates’.  Call this Container
     ‘MonitorTool’ .

  3. Implement monitoring so that you regularly sample the ‘[files
     chunks candidates clones]’ and calculate statistics of the
     processing time at each time interval.  You want to be able to
     answer questions such as whether the processing time to create a
     new unit (e.g.  a chunk or a clone) increases or decreases with the
     number of already processed units, and whether the processing time
     changes linearly or exponentially.

  4. Visualising these collected statistics can be done as you please,
     e.g.  text-only in a terminal or by implementing a tiny web app.
     Do note that identifying trends in processing times will be more
     challenging with text-only output; graphs can help here.

  5. Modify ‘all-at-once.yaml’ so that your container starts alongside
     with cljDetector and attaches to the database.

  6. Run ‘all-at-once.yaml’ on the full Qualitas Corpus and collect
     statistics through your MonitorTool.

   *Optional (not mandatory) Tasks*
   • Collect statistics from inside the cljDetector container to see
     which processes are consuming most CPU each time-frame.  Correlate
     this with the execution stage and the rest of your collected
     statistics.

   • Since the clone expansion works with the database it is possible to
     pause execution (at the right moment - just before a new candidate
     is fetched from storage for processing) and resume later.  This
     requires at least (a) a mechanism for signalling the cljDetector
     process (e.g.  through an open network socket), (b) modifications
     to ‘expander/expand-clones’ to poll if a signal has been received
     before recurring with a new candidate, and (c) modifications to
     ‘core/-main’ to check for a command line flag “Resume” that
     overrides the usual execution and jumps directly to calling
     ‘expander/expand-clones’ again.  In addition, adding timestamped
     status updates so that total execution times can still be
     calculated would be helpful.

14 Summary
**********

Well, here we are; the end of this part of the course.  Please revisit
the *note Learning Outcomes:: to verify whether you now meet them.
Starting with the four V’s of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, and
Value), we have explored what these imply for how we may solve Big Data
Analytics tasks.  Indeed, we have also discussed whether Big Data really
is that big anymore.  The conclusion is (not surprisingly) “it depends”.

   As a concrete example, we introduce the analytics task of identifying
code clones in a relatively large collection of source code (i.e., the
Qualitas Corpus), and discuss what makes this task a Big Data Analytics
task.  Identifying code clones is a relevant industry challenge, but it
is also a representative for a larger class of problems to identify
matches between ‘some data’ and ‘some large repository of other data’.

   Specifically, we explore three of the four V’s:

   *Variety* Each file that is processed contain a mix of code and
non-code (empty lines and comments), so we preprocess the files to
remove any non-code from further analysis.  The challenge here is to
maintain the locations in the original file so that any found clones can
be visualised as they were originally submitted.  We focus on Type-I
clones, but further variety challenges can be explored if we enhance the
analysis to also work with Type-II (which may be possible with the help
of an abstract syntax tree for each file) or Type-III clones (which is a
completely different ballgame, and require semantic understanding as
well as syntactic agnosticism).

   *Velocity* In this scenario each file arrives separately as a stream
of data.  For example, this can be seen as simulating a code repository
where each new file represent a new commit to the repository.  We
explore a solution that incrementally builds up a collection of existing
files and clones and match every new file against what was previously
available.  The challenge here is to process each new file quickly, and
so the data need to be represented in a way that enables this.  Some
performance antipatterns such as the Ramp are difficult to avoid here,
so the focus shifts to mitigating the effects of any unavoidable
antipatterns.

   *Volume* In this scenario we use the entire QualitasCorpus as an
existing dataset, and the challenge is not necessarily to process the
data at speed (even if this is still desirable), but to process the data
within given resource constraints (CPUs, number of threads, and heap
size in particular).  It becomes especially important to precisely match
the required resources with the most cost-efficient deployment when
running on a cloud provider.  In order to process large volumes of data
we introduce Map/Reduce algorithms, and explore their impact on data
representations.

   In practice, a code clone detection solution would consist of a
combination of these two approaches, using an initial set of data
(volume) and then continuously add new commits as they are made
(velocity).  Also, in practice, it should be possible to bulk-add a new
block of data without having to reprocess everything.

   One point that J.  Tigani made in their “Big Data is Dead” article is
that most of the time, most of the data is rarely touched after a week,
a month, or a year.  Code clones are different, since every new piece of
code always need to be matched against everything seen before.  Since
I’ve already argued that code clone detection is representative of a
bigger class of analysis tasks, this implies that big data is not dead.
It is just resting.

   But what if we don’t need to check against all previously seen code
all the time?  Let’s form the hypothesis that _a few clones stand for
most of the occurrences_.  This would be true if, for example, there are
specific programming patterns that are more frequent than others (a more
glib explanation is that some answers on StackOverflow are more useful
than others).  It is even possible to verify this through the data
already collected by cljDetector (see graph below).  If this is true,
then one way to streamline the _velocity_ aspect is to only check new
code against the list of previously found clones, and schedule a full
analysis once every night, week, or even month.  The conclusion of
_this_ is that data does not need to be big data just because it is
plenty, it all boils down to what you want to do with it.

   Studying this graph, we see that there are indeed a few clones that
are very frequent, but it quickly tapers off to less than 50 instances
per clone.  Thus, it would make sense to check against these “popular”
clones first, but we would eventually have to check against the entire
codebase anyway.

   With respect to which technology to use, we have explored a variety
of programming languages and tools, including microservices in the form
of Docker, shell scripts to perform simple tasks (we are seriously
under-utilising shell scripts here: we have once implemented the full
clone detection in a 160-odd lines script just to prove that you do not
need fancy tools), and a choice of two programming languages to perform
the clone detection.  We have deliberately _not_ used any of the much
touted Big Data Tools such as Hadoop, Spark, or even Disco, since the
underlying principles are much more important than the specific tool.
The choices of programming languages is not a coincidence; they have
inherent support for many of the same functional programming mechanisms
that the Big Data tools try to massively scale, and we make intensive
use of these features in our solutions.

   One tool used which deserves much more credit than usually given is
the database.  As seen in the assignments, the database tool is able to
optimise and parallelise to a much greater extent than anything we can
hope to accomplish with our user-space code within a reasonable budget.
We use a NoSQL database, i.e.  MongoDB, but there is nothing inherently
NoSQL-y with the data we have; a traditional relational database would
work just as well and today they can be horizontally scaled just as
easily across multiple hardware nodes.  With a well used database, bigly
data need to be much larger to become Big Data.

   One of the reasons why we picked Clojure for the all-at-once analysis
is because in my experience this language forces you to pay attention to
the structure of the data you are processing rather than the algorithm
with which you are going to process it, and when the data structures
come into focus you start paying attention to which problem you are
actually trying to solve.  In that spirit, we’d like to end with a
precis of a quote from D.  Adams in “The Hitchhikers Guide to the
Galaxy”:

     Loonquawl: “Do you have... er, that is...”

     Deep Thought: “An answer for you?  Yes I have.” “Though I don’t
     think that you’re going to like it”

     “The answer to the Great Question... is...”

     “Forty-two.”

     Loonquawl: “Forty-two!  Is that all you’ve got to show for seven
     and a half million years’ work?”

     Deep Thought: “I checked it very thoroughly, and that quite
     definitely is the answer.  I think the problem, to be quite honest
     with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question
     is.”
